    <h1 id="firstTitle">About Me</h1>
    <div class="about"><img src="me.jpg"><p>Hey there! I'm Austin Lopez McDonald, a fellow passionate game developer and Blender 3D artist! I was born in Ecuador and have lived all throughout South America. I am currently a sophomore at Northwestern University studying Film and Computer Science.
        <br><br>As a game developer, I am extremely interested in the potential of world building and story telling that video games, especially those with adaptive narratives, have to offer. My dream is to build the tools to create a game that can tell a unique experience to every individual player, and explore the untapped potential of video game storytelling.
